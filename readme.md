Herobrine
====================
Herobrine is a legend of a lost miner who is supposed to exist in Minecraft, although he doesn't and was just some rumor made up. However, he is said to haunt the player and the game, the other Herobrine plugins acted although we was a mugger, disobeying the legends. But this plugin aims to set things straight and bring back the legend that is Herobrine.
